Question 1: When the dice was rolled only 10 times the fraction of times it rolled a specific number was more pronounced. 
This meant that the distribution wasn't as even as it should have been (1/6 for each number on the die). When the 
amount of rolls became higher the distribution of times each number was rolled became about even (1/6 for each).


Question 2: The even split between low and high numbers was about 3 percent. That is very suprising because one would expect
it to be about 50 percent since there is an even split of numbers between 1-3 and 4-6.

Question3: The distribution that I see is that one is less likely to roll very low or high sums while one is very likely
to roll middle sums. This is most due to the fact that there are more combinations of numbers that result in the middle 
numbers while there are less combinations of numbers that result in the upper or lower numbers. Thus,
the sum values execute a bell-curve more or less.

Question 4: I would stand on the value of 19 because the probability of busting is about 5 percent. Thus, it is the value 
with the highest ratio of not busting while still having a high value to beat the dealer. After 19, the probabilities of 
busting become much higher.

Question 5: The probability of beating the dealer given this counting algorithm is between 35-40 percent. Whenever the 
stand value is increased, the probability of guessing right also increasing. Thus, I can use this counting alogrithm to 
stand at very high values and possibly win at blackjack. LETS GO TO THE CASINO BOYS. DADDY NEEDS A NEW PAIR OF SHOES!
